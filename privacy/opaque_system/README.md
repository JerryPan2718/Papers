- Sources of friction
	- Security, Each of use, and Scalability
	- 1. Multiple layers of security on top of TEEs across software stack
	- 2. Integrate into existing analytics/AI workflows
	- 3. Governed data sharing and collaboration across data teams/organizations
	- 4. Efficient scaling across compute clusters and teams
